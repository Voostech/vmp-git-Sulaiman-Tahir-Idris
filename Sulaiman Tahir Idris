Hello VMP!
I've learned how to pull, push and open new repositories, I've also watched a couple of videos on YouTube on how Git and GitHub works
I learned that I can be able to upload my assignments here on this repository using the push command and that I can add the git extension on my
VSCode and upload directly.
I can also use the GitHub desktop app to upload a whole project i.e the folder where my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some of the website assets (Images, Fonts etc) are saved.
I've also learned that the term fork is used when a person work on a project that's not his for example if I edit the main file saved on the VoosTech repository and push it.
I think that's all I've learned for now and I hope to learn much more in the future.
I just linked this md file to my GitHub Desktop.
